# assemblyStringPrimativesandMacros

This program asks the user to enter 10 numbers using the keyboard and returns the 10 numbers, their sum & truncated average. Each number is entered into memory as a sting after which the string is validated to check its positive or negative value and to ensure the number is valid.	After the string is validated, it is converted from BYTE string to a SDWORD and put into an array.
After 10 values are stored in the array as integers, the Sum and averages are calculated and stored in variables. Then the program returns the array in the console by converting each integer to a string. The sum and average is also returned in the output as a string.
